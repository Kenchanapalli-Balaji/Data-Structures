/*
 step 1: Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
 step 2: If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the 
          search key.
 step 3: Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
 step 4:Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
 step 5:Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.
